#   | Description:                                      |
#   | - This method partitions a linked list around a   |
#   |   value `x`.                                      |
#   | - It rearranges the nodes so that all nodes less  |
#   |   than `x` come before all nodes greater or equal |
#   |   to `x`.                                         |
#   |                                                   |
#   | Tips:                                             |
#   | - We use two dummy nodes, `dummy1` and `dummy2`,  |
#   |   to build two separate lists: one for elements   |
#   |   smaller than `x` and one for elements greater   |
#   |   or equal to `x`.                                |
#   | - `prev1` and `prev2` help us keep track of the   |
#   |   last nodes in these lists.                      |
#   | - Finally, we merge these two lists by setting    |
#   |   `prev1.next = dummy2.next`.                     |
#   | - The head of the resulting list becomes          |
#   |   `dummy1.next`.                                  |
